.DESCRIPTION
    When forcing TLS encryption on outgoing e-mails due to GDPR requirements, Exchange Online will try sending the e-mail for 24 hours before dropping it and returning a default NDR (non-delivery report).

    Waiting 24 hours to get informed if your e-mail was delivered or not is not ideal, thus this script was created.

    The script will run on a schedule (say every 15 minutes) and look for e-mails send and recieved in the past 16 minutes. 
    If any of the e-mails in those past 16 minutes are delayed due to lack of TLS support with the recipient, the script will send a custom e-mail to the sender right away.
